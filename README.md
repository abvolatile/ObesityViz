Visualization of the global prevalence of obesity between 2003 and 2013

See it here: https://abvolatile.github.io/ObesityViz/

Original data from IHME Global Burden of Disease 2013 Obesity Prevalence 1990-2013 study 
(http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2013-gbd-2013-obesity-prevalence-1990-2013)

I used only data from the past 10 years, and only for obesity (BMI >= 30.0). 

The globe shows the average percentage of obesity for all countries for the current year selected. 

The globe can be rotated by clicking and dragging on the water (or by selecting a country from the dropdown list).

A country can be selected from the globe or from the dropdown list, which updates the chart with the selected country's
average obesity for males vs females by age group (for the current year selected).


(currently there's an issue with the map not having data for a few countries - so if you click on one of these (colored black) there will be no data in the chart)
